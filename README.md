# Binary-Decision-Diagram

Welcome to the Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) project repository! 🗂️🔀

Dive into the world of efficient decision-making with this C-based Binary Decision Diagram implementation. Harness the power of BDDs to build, manipulate, and evaluate boolean functions, offering a compact and systematic representation for complex decision processes. Whether you're a computer scientist, logician, or enthusiast of efficient data structures, this project promises to deepen your understanding of BDDs and their applications.

Key Features:

🗂️ BDD Construction: Implement and explore the construction of BDDs, employing various techniques to create compact and expressive decision trees.

🔀 Boolean Function Conversion: Convert boolean functions into their equivalent BDD representation, simplifying complex logic expressions and facilitating faster evaluation.

🔎 Input Evaluation: Leverage BDDs to efficiently evaluate inputs, optimizing the decision-making process and reducing computational overhead.

💡 Testing and Evaluation: Test BDD operations rigorously, verifying their correctness and evaluating their performance under different data scenarios.

🌐 C Implementation: Discover the elegance and efficiency of C as you delve into the implementation of BDDs, harnessing its power to handle complex logic operations.

As a firm believer in the versatility and power of data structures, I crafted this project to unravel the mystery behind Binary Decision Diagrams. With a focus on performance and functionality, I've designed functions to create, manipulate, and evaluate BDDs, enabling users to streamline complex decision processes and achieve optimal outcomes.
